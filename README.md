WP-Plugin-Base
==============

Minimal Wordpress plugin base framework and boilerplate. This is for my personal use and to my personal taste. By all means, use it, but don't complain.


## Usage:
1. Clone into your new plugin folder
2. `cd framework; composer install`
3. Rename `my-plugin*.*` to your taste
4. Search and Replace all instances of `my-plugin` and `MyPlugin`
5. Edit meta description and info in what was formerly `my-plugin.php`
